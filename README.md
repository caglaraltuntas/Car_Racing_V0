# Self-Driving Agent on the video game of Torcs
In this project, a DQN agent is implemented with the method of deep reinforcement learning with demonstration in the OpenAI Gym environment called Car Racing-V0. The main idea behind this approach is to provide the agent with the most useful observations collected by a human expert, rather than allowing the agent to explore the environment on its own and collect insignificant experiences with the pure reinforcement learning methods.
